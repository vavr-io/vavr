Currently, there are two significant branches:
- `master` (represents a stream of work leading to the release of a new major version)
- `version/0.x` (continues 0.10.5 with minor updates and bugfixes)

That means effectively two things:
- you can't do breaking changes in `version/0.x` branch
- it's a good idea to create another Pull Request for compatible changes to `version/0.x` branch
