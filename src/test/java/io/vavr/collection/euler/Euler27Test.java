/**
 * <strong>Problem 27: Quadratic primes</strong>
 * <p>
 * Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
 * <p>
 * n² + n + 41
 * <p>
 * It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive
 * values n = 0 to 39. However, when n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is
 * divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41, 41² + 41 + 41 is clearly
 * divisible by 41.
 * <p>
 * The incredible formula n² − 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80
 * primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. The product of the
 * coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.
 * <p>
 * Considering quadratics of the form:
 * <p>
 * n² + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000 <p>
 * where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n e.g. |11| = 11 and |−4| = 4
 * <p>
 * Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression
 * that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n,
 * starting with n = 0.
 * <p>
