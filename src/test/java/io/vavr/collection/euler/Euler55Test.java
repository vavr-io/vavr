     * <strong>Problem 55: Lychrel numbers</strong>
     * <p>
     * If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
     * <p>
     * Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
     * <ul>
     * <li>349 + 943 = 1292
     * <li>1292 + 2921 = 4213
     * <li>4213 + 3124 = 7337
     * </ul>
     * That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
     * <p>
     * Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome.
     * A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number.
     * Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume
     * that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number
     * below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or,
     * (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome.
     * In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations
     * before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).
     * <p>
     * Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers;
     * the first example is 4994.
     * <p>
     * How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?
     * <p>
