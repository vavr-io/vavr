/**
 * <strong>Problem 31: Coin sums</strong>
 * <p>In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:</p>
 * <blockquote>1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).</blockquote>
 * <p>It is possible to make £2 in the following way:</p>
 * <blockquote>1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p</blockquote>
 * <p>How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?</p>
