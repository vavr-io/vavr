/**
 * <strong>Problem 22: Names scores</strong>
 * <p>
 * Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file
 * containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into
 * alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
 * multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name
 * score.
 * <p>
 * For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is
 * worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN
 * would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
 * <p>
 * What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
 * <p>
 * See also <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=22">projecteuler.net
 * problem 22</a>.
