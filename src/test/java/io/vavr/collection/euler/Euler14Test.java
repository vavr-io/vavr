     * <strong>Problem 14: Longest Collatz sequence</strong>
     * <p>
     * The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     * n → n/2 (n is even)
     * n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     * Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     * 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     * It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms.
     * Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
     * <p>
     * Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
     * <p>
     * NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
     * <p>
