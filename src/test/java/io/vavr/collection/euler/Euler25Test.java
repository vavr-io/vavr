/**
 * <strong>Problem 25: 1000-digit Fibonacci number</strong>
 * <p>
 * The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
 * <p>
 * Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1. Hence the first 12 terms will be:
 * <pre>
 * F1 = 1
 * F2 = 1
 * F3 = 2
 * F4 = 3
 * F5 = 5
 * F6 = 8
 * F7 = 13
 * F8 = 21
 * F9 = 34
 * F10 = 55
 * F11 = 89
 * F12 = 144
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.
 * <p>
 * What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
 * <p>
