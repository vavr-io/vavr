Vavr is an object-functional language extension to Java 8 that aims to reduce the number of lines of code and increase code quality.
It provides persistent collections, functional abstractions for error handling, concurrent programming, pattern matching, and much more.

Vavr fuses the power of object-oriented programming with the elegance and robustness of functional programming.
The most interesting part is a feature-rich, persistent collection library that smoothly integrates with Java's standard collections.

Because Vavr does not depend on any libraries (other than the JVM), you can easily add it as a standalone .jar to your classpath.
